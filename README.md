# Shopping Trends Analysis using Python & Power BI

## 1. Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing customer shopping behavior to identify trends and patterns. Python was used for data cleaning, exploration, and statistical analysis, while Power BI was used to build an interactive dashboard that visually represents key insights.

The project follows a clear data pipeline:

* Raw data analysis and cleaning using Python
* Exporting cleaned data
* Visualizing insights using Power BI

## 4. Data Analysis (Python)

The Python analysis includes:

* Loading and inspecting the dataset
* Handling missing values and duplicates
* Dropping irrelevant columns
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Statistical summaries and visualizations

Key analyses performed:

* Gender distribution and purchasing behavior
* Average purchase amount by gender and age
* Most purchased items and categories
* Seasonal impact on purchases
* Payment methods distribution
* Impact of discounts and subscriptions

All analysis steps are documented and reproducible in the Jupyter Notebook.

## 5. Power BI Dashboard

The Power BI dashboard provides an interactive view of the analysis results, including:

* Customer demographics overview
* Purchase amount analysis
* Category and item performance
* Seasonal and discount-based insights

### Note on Deployment

The Power BI dashboard is included in this repository as a **.pbix** file and can be opened locally using **Power BI Desktop**.

Screenshots of the dashboard are provided for preview purposes.

## 6. Key Insights

* Purchasing behavior varies significantly across genders and age groups
* Certain product categories dominate total sales
* Seasonal trends have a clear impact on average purchase value
* Discounts influence purchase amounts positively
* Subscription status affects customer review ratings

# Short Report Text (Ready to Submit)

This project aims to analyze shopping trends using Python and visualize the results through an interactive Power BI dashboard. The dataset was first explored and cleaned using Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy. Exploratory Data Analysis techniques were applied to understand customer behavior, purchasing patterns, and the impact of different factors such as gender, age, seasonality, and discounts.

The cleaned and analyzed data was then visualized using Power BI, allowing for interactive exploration of key insights. The final dashboard provides a clear and intuitive representation of the analysis results. This project demonstrates practical data analysis skills, effective visualization techniques, and proper project documentation using GitHub.
